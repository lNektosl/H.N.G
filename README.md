# H.N.G – Systems & Algorithms Playground (Unity Project)

H.N.G is a Unity-based experimental project designed as a playground for building and testing complex interacting systems, gameplay mechanics, and algorithmic solutions.

## The primary goal of this project is exploring:

- Complex system interactions

- State management

- Algorithm implementation

- Data management inside real-time environments

- Scalable and maintainable architecture in Unity

# Core Technical Focus
1. System Architecture

- Modular script structure

- Separation of responsibilities

- Component-based design

- Clear interaction between game systems

- The project avoids monolithic scripts and promotes clean boundaries between systems.

2. Complex Interactions

The project explores:

- Inter-system communication

- Event-driven logic

- State transitions

- Behavior management

- Dynamic object interaction

- This allowed experimentation with scalable interaction patterns instead of hardcoded logic.

3. Algorithms & Logic

Used as a playground for:

- Pathfinding logic

- State machines

- Object lifecycle management

- Custom interaction rules

- Performance-aware update cycles

- The project emphasizes understanding why a system works, not just making it work.

4. Data Management

- Runtime data handling

- Object state persistence

- Structured in-memory data organization

- Clean separation between game state and presentation

- Focus was placed on keeping data predictable and maintainable as systems grow.

# Technologies Used

- Unity (2D)

- C#

- Unity Physics & Collision System

- Scriptable components

- Scene management

- Custom interaction systems

- Architectural Approach

- The project follows a modular and extensible design philosophy:

- Single responsibility principle in gameplay components

- Event-based interactions where appropriate

- Clear separation between control logic and visual representation

- The goal was to avoid “God objects” and tightly coupled systems.

# Learning Goals Demonstrated

- Designing scalable interactive systems

- Managing complexity in real-time environments

- Implementing algorithms in gameplay context

- Writing maintainable C# code in Unity

- Understanding system-level architecture beyond basic scripting

# Project Status

This project is an experimental playground.

It is not a commercial product, but a structured environment for:

- Testing ideas

- Improving architectural thinking

- Practicing system design in interactive software


While built inside a game engine, this project reflects skills transferable to general software engineering:

- System decomposition

- State management

- Event-driven architecture

- Data flow control

- Algorithm implementation in dynamic environments

It represents practical experimentation with complex logic rather than just visual game development.
